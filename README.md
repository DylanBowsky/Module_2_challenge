## Module_2_challenge Testing and data application 

    This project focused on the ability to pull data from a csv file and make it interactive with a user.

## The goal for this application 
    We want it to be user friendly and interactive with the user.

## Technologies used

    In this project we used fire, csv, pathlib, run, and questionary.
    Also a testing enviroment was created to make sure the functions are working.

## Installation guide
    We will need to make sure fire and questionary are installed (Commonly used for install "Pip install fire/questionary")

## Example 

    Ask for the csv file we need (Daily_rate_sheet.csv)
    asks for credit score, debt, income, loan, and home value
    After the the data has been input it will use the filter functions created to generate a list of qualifying loans pulled from the daily rate sheet file
